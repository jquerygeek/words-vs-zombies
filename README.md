Words with Friends meets Plants vs. Zombies.

## Getting Started

You'll need to run a local HTTP server to make this works, because of security restrictions in running browsers. For me I use [httpster](https://github.com/SimbCo/httpster)

## TODO

- Letter verification
- Moving Letters after being placed
- Re-calling letters before "play" is pressed
- etc...
- Allow multiple players to play a game from one computer
- Move logic to server to avoid cheating
- Add Zombies, Bombs and other "features"
- Allow multiple players to play across the Internet
- Create a leaderboard
- Mobile Web
